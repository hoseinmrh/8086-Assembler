## Intruduction
An assembler is a type of computer program that takes in basic instructions and converts them into a pattern of bits that the computer's processor can use to perform basic operations. The assembler's job is to convert assembler or assembly language code into machine code that the computer can then read and execute. <br/>

In this app you can write your own assembly code using simple instructions such as `And`, `Or`, `Sub` ,`Add` and `Jump`. Then you will see your assembly code converted to machine code.

## Features
- Implementation of foreward and backward jump
- Clean code
- All of x86 registers are included

## Project Structure
The project follows a specific structure to organize its files and directories:
```
diabetes-prediction-app/
├── Project.py
├── README.md
```
- `Project.py`: Main script file that runs the assembler.
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing information about the project.

## Requirements
To run the x86 assembler, you need to have the following installed on your system:
* Python (version 3.0 or higher)
* Git command line tool (or Git GUI client) to clone the repository.

## Usage Guide
1. Open a terminal and clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/hoseinmrh/8086-Assemble`
2. Start and enter your code line by line. Do not use `,` to seperate registers and use space only.
